# Kana Quiz
Little hirakana/katakana quiz I wrote to quiz myself using Godot, it is currently set up for an Android screen of 1080 by 2460 so it looks a bit strange on a computer but it still works.

Switching between hirakana and katakana is done by pressing/clicking the title label. 

It takes about 10 right answers to fill up a box with green, so you can keep track of which kana you already know and which you still need to practice :)
